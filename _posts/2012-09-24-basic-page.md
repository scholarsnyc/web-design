Your mission is pretty simple.

Create a basic HTML file. It doesn't have to be pretty. It just has to work.

1. Start off the [HTML Skeleton](https://gist.github.com/1400242) that I made for you because I'm a nice guy.
2. You're going to be doing most of your work inside of the `<body></body>` tag. That said, you may also want to change the contents of the `<title></title>` tag to something relevant.
3. Basically, you're going to make a basic page telling me about yourself. I'm not as concerned about the content as much as I am that you get the hang of using the basic HTML tages we discussed. Keep in mind, however, this will being on the Internet and if you embarrass yourself or me, I will deduct points (this means you, Jared).
4. Use the following tags in your page:

	* `<strong></strong>`
	* `<em></em>`
	* `<h1></h1>`
	* `<h2></h2>`
	* `<ul></ul>`
	* `<li></li>`

5. Incude a link and include an image.

I'll show you where to submit it on Tuesday. I've been doing this long enough to know that those who submit things the earliest tend to submit the worst work. So, I'm saving you form yourself by hiding the submission link.
