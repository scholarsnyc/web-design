**NEWS FLASH**: Websites often have more than one page. Yea, I know—crazy, right? Given that reality, we're going to have to learn how to deal with annoyances like files and folders and whatnot.

Your assignment today is to download [this repository from Github][repo]. Github is a place where people share code. In that spirit, I have shared some code with you. The only problem is that the code I have shared with you is absolutely terrible. It's your job to fix it—not mine.

You have been put in charge of the website for the Noodle Emporium. The previously web designer (me) was working on it, but he saw a shiny object and got distracted. You've been hired to take over the wreckage.

It's three pages and a stylesheet: none of which have been linked together properly. Link the pages and use the HTML and CSS wizardry you've learned so far to make them pretty. Good luck.
