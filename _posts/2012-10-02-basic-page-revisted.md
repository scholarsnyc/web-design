title: Adding Some Class to Your Basic HTML Page
categories: assignments
due: October 2, 2012

**This is a pretty simple assignment:** Revisit the [first assignment that you completed for this course][assignment1]. Add in some classes into your page and style them with CSS.

I should see at least 5 classes and a grand total of 15 properties defined.
