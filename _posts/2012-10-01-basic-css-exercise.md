I drafted up a quick page for you to play around with. [Click here][gist] to check it out. Copy and paste it into either JSBin or TextWranglerâ€”whatever makes you happier.[^tw] You will definitely want to Google some CSS properties. Google is your friend. Don't shun your friend. The more awesome stuff you do, the higher your grade will be. I've listed the bare minimum below.

[^tw]: If you choose to go the TextWrangler route, you will need to make two files: an HTML file and a CSS file. I like to call my CSS files `style.css` when I have nothing better to name them.

Your mission is as follows:

* Change the background of the `<h1>` tag to a different color.
* Change the color and size of the list elements in the ordered list.
* Change the font of the paragraphs.
* Change the size of the `<h2>` tag.

You have until the end of the period. Email me the link or the pages.
